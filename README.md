# Datasets:
1. Blotter Data (link: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/044f2016-1dfd-4ab0-bc1e-065da05fca2e)

The set is detailing crime incident data after it has been transformed to meet UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) standards from 2016 until 2023 which can be accounted by neighborhood
(NOTE: this data set was too large to submit through the GitHub file upload through the browser and when using other methods such as git lfs and console commands to upload the file 
a portion of it was cut off. The data in the jupyter notebooks contains the full data set but if this repository was copied directly please keep that in mind so that if you want the 
complete data set please use the link above to download it directly from WPRDC. All of the code that uses that data set was devolped independently so it should all still run 
correctly, but there might be a slight change in values.)

2. Arrests (link: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data/resource/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f)

This data set describes information on arrests that have taken place within the city of Pittsburgh, including the neighborhood where each arrest occurred.

3. Trees(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees/resource/1515a93c-73e3-4425-9b35-1cd11b2196da)

This set plots all the trees in Pittsburgh and their locations by neighborhood. 

# Overview:
Using data sets provided by WPRDC and our own subjective metrics of danger, police efficiency, and the environment we will be making an argument as to why one neighborhood could be considered the best in Pittsburgh
